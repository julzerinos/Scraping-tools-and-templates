# Scraping Tools and Templates

This repository aims to be an educational collection of repeatable methods and concepts appearing in python-based web scraping with the use of Scrapy and Selenium. The content has been created based on long exposure to this field and is further divided into three categories, reffered to as:

1. Tools - a selection of various utilities, helper functions and other tools, the existence of which can make working with web scraping easier.
2. Techniques - a compendium of useful functions and methods with explanation on their nature
3. Templates - an assortment of general examples of spiders (for their respective website types), which require little tweaking to get running

## Context

A few assumptions and specifications are made for the nature of this webscraping endeavor, and thus reading through most of the README is advised.
